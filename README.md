# FriendFinder

Please ignore the questions being asked of the user. I "invented" them.  Random would be a good word.

The app seems to work. It will fail if there are no "friends" in the json file.  I haven't bothered to fix this.

The javascript that deals with buttons being pressed is in survey.html.  I think it should probably be somewhere else, but I don't think a place for it was given in the "recommended file tree."
